# 🌍 Global Economic & Population Analysis

An end-to-end data analytics project focused on analyzing **global GDP, population, literacy, and sectoral contributions** using **Excel, SQL, Statistics, and Power BI**.  
The project aims to identify long-term economic and demographic trends and convert raw data into meaningful business insights.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes historical economic and population data across countries to understand:
- GDP growth patterns
- Population trends
- Literacy and productivity impact
- Sector-wise economic contribution (Agriculture, Industry, Services)

The analysis is presented through **interactive Power BI dashboards** and supported by structured data cleaning and modeling.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze long-term GDP and population trends across countries  
- Understand the relationship between population, literacy, and economic growth  
- Identify dominant economic sectors by country and region  
- Build an interactive dashboard for data-driven decision-making  

---

## 🗂️ Data Sources

- **World Bank GDP Dataset (1960–2016)**
- **Population per Country Dataset**
- **CountriesWorld SQL Database**
- **Country Metadata for standardization**

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Removed duplicate and inconsistent country records  
- Handled missing values using defined business rules  
- Filtered countries with insufficient historical data  
- Standardized country names and country codes  
- Transformed wide time-series data into analysis-ready formats  

*(Data cleaning performed using Excel Power Query and SQL)*

---

## 🧩 Data Modeling

- Implemented **one-to-many relationships**
- Country table used as a reference (dimension) table  
- GDP and Population tables used as fact tables  
- Relationships created using **Country Name / Country Code**
- Optimized model for performance and accurate filtering

## 🧮 DAX Calculations

Key DAX measures created:
- Total GDP  
- Average GDP  
- Population Growth  
- Sector Contribution (%)  
- Country-wise and Year-wise aggregations  

DAX enabled dynamic calculations based on slicers and filters.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Features

- Population growth trends over time  
- GDP growth analysis by country and decade  
- Sector contribution comparison  
- Interactive slicers for Country and Year  
- Clean and user-friendly visual design  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- GDP growth is concentrated among a few major economies  
- Population size alone does not guarantee economic strength  
- Service sector dominates GDP contribution globally  
- Literacy plays a significant role in economic development
